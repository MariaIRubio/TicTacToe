## Group project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Assign specific tasks to team members. 

For example:
-	One team member can work on the game logic.
-	Another can handle user input and display.
-	Someone else can implement the replay option.

The goal of the game is to get three of your marks ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal on the 3x3 grid.

#### Game Rules:

-	The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
-	Two players take turns to make moves, one with 'X' and the other with 'O'.
-	The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
-	If all 9 squares are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

#### Gameplay:

-	Player 1 starts with 'X', and Player 2 starts with 'O'.
-	Players take turns to enter the row and column coordinates (0-2) where they want to place their mark.
-	The game checks if the move is valid (the chosen square is empty and within the grid).
-	If the move is valid, the mark is placed on the board, and the updated board is displayed.
-	The game continues until one player wins or it ends in a draw.

#### Winning Conditions:

-	To win, a player must have three of their marks ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal.

#### Draw Condition:

-	If all squares are filled, and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

#### Replay Option:

-	After the game ends, you will be prompted to replay. Type 'yes' to play again or any other input to exit the game.

#### Additional Guidelines:

-	Remember to enter the row and column coordinates separated by a space.
-	If you enter an invalid move, the game will prompt you to try again.
-	Have fun and enjoy the game with your opponent!
